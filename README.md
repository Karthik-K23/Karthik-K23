## Hi there !, this is ***Karthik.K***

### ***Data Analytics is my passion. I have been working in the banking domain from 5 years and would like to follow my passion and become a data professional.  I want to transition into data professional from a banking background. When I was first starting out on my data professional journey I was extremely lost; I knew very few resources to learn about this field from. Now, as I have decided to explore this field further more, I am  showcasing all my skillsets and learning through this GitHub portfolio .***

### Please find the descriptions of the Projects showcased in this portfolio:


### **A. Sales-Insight:**
   Data Analysis Project using MySQL and Power BI Solving the problem of providing sales insight to the sales director of Atliq Hardware Company for decision support and automate them to reduce time spent in data gathering analysing and reporting using Power BI dashboard. Data analytics queries are run on MYSQL database to pull necessary information required to do data analysis and Create the required dashboard. Power BI is used to perform ETL and data cleaning operation to make data ready to build the dashboard.
    
### **B. Data Analysis using MySQL and Tableau:**
   Employees data base is used to define problems or business tasks. MySQL is used to execute a query to get relevant data set from the database. The relevant dataset is then exported to Tableau and used to create professional and understandable visualisations in Tableau to present as dashboard to be used by the stakeholders.
    
### **C. Data Analysis using Python, MySQL and Tableau:**
   MySQL is used to query the required data for analysis and is exported as CSV for further data processing in python. Then the pre-processed data is used to create logistic regression and get predictions. PyMySQL is used to integrate python and MySQL to create the database that is used in Tableau to do further data analysis and get valuable insights. 

### **D. Penguins web app deployed on Heroku:**
   Using Palmer penguin dataset to create a random forest classifier model in python to predict this species. The pickled model is used in Streamlit web framework to create the web application. This gets the users input and predicts the species of penguin using the model. This webapp is deployed on Heroku platform. 
   
### **E. Exploratory Data Analysis Project:** 

### 1. Tracking Kaggle Titanic challenge: 
Analysing and answering different problems based on the data set. Throughout the analysis, data is visualised using seaborn and matplotlib to get more insight about the data 
### **2. Stock market analysis Project:**
